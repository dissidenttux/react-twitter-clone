The basic primary concept is to organize CSS classes and make them into reuseable "modules" (objects)
with "states" (conditions) to apply to elements.
This results in, you guessed it, modularity and DRYer code.

/* FIRST PRINCIPLE principle of OOCSS: Separate Structure and Skin (covered below). */

/* SECOND PRINCIPLE: Separate Container and Content. */
/* This means that every class should NOT style elements (such as an <h3>) to be dependent on a containing element
(such as a header or footer). These should be separate and reusable ANYWHERE in the document regardless of
structural context.
For contextual clarity, "content" refers to elements like images, paragraphs, and divs, which are then nestled
into other "container" elements.
i.e. "Containers can be represented by a structure class". 

SPECIAL NOTE: If an element fits as a "structure" */

/* -------------------- FIRST PRINCIPLE: Separate Structure and Skin ----------- */

/* STRUCTURES - define repeating "invisible" patterns (like width, margins, etc) as reusable STRUCTURES
(I.e. how things are laid out)
Hint: An example of an entire "structure" would be a "btn-small" class, or small button, and all the invisible patterns
would be the contents of that class. I.e., everything that would make a "button" look like a button and that
alone would belong here, like: height, width, margins, overflow, padding, etc..
Class examples: "btn-small", "btn-right" */

.nav {
    display: flex;
}

.nav-logo {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
}

.nav-userid {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: left;
}

/*--------------------------------------------*/
/* SKINS - define repeating visual patterns as reusable SKINS
(I.e. what the layout looks like)
Hint: An example of a skin class will be looked in the "btn" example I provided above. The structure of the
button is already accomplished (i.e., we *made* a button); now we just have to apply a skin to the button.
Keep in mind that this includes ANYTHING visual, like: colors, gradients, visible borders, shadows, etc.
Class examples: "btn-green", "heading-green" */
